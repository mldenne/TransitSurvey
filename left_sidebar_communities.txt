Why look at your neighbors' data?
Besides the natural curiosity to know what your neighbors' are up to, knowing how many commuters are in your area is helpful for decision makers when the topic of public transportation arises. Knowing how many commuters are on what roads helps to establish where new public transportation routes might be useful. Seeing the cost savings to commuters helps communities grow because people are putting those monies back into the community rather than into their commutes.
