### Why look at your neighbors' data?

Other than the curiosity to know what your neighbors' are up to, knowing how many commuters are in your area is helpful in determining many public transportation decisions. Seeing a visual representation (via heatmap) of how many commuters are on what roads helps to establish where new public transportation routes would be most beneficial. And with the potential cost savings of public transportation, community officials are able to quantify the amount of monies that could be pumped back into the local businesses.
